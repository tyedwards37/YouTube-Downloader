Project: YouTube Downloader 
by Tyler Edwards 
Started November 1st, 2023

Description: A program that prompts the user for a YouTube video then downloads it onto the user's computer as an MP3, MP4, or both. 
Potential Next Step: Making a website layout so that the functionality can be carried out without direct use of the terminal. 

Language: Python

Reason: Want to be able to download YouTube videos without having to go to a sketchy website

Successes: Was able to implement error handling using past python knowledge

Setbacks: Had to redownload ffmpeg which took a very long time, figuring out the conversion of an MP4 file to an MP3 programmatically 

Learned: how to work with pytube, how to convert an mp4 to an mp3 programmatically
